# CO2-Emissions_Project

Viewable online at https://imprint-co2-calculator.herokuapp.com/

To run the files locally, run 3 tabs in the terminal with;
"npm run build"
"npm run server:dev"
"mongod"
The MongoClient.connect link will also need to be changed to a local host.

The app will then be viewable on http://localhost:3000/
